Included an implementation of the Gobblet game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobblet). This was a project for my Artificial Intelligence. The AI is driven very poorly, but the game works well with player vs player. It is not complete, but it does handle all events except winning event. When the conditions are met for a winner, the program simply prints "four in a row!"

To run, you need to you use python2.7 and pythong.pygame
